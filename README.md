## This is a C version FT8 encode and decode module. It is based on the standard version from WSJT-X's sources.
### Just for a port to Cortex-M4/M7
###TODO:
* A whole framework
* Fill in the basic proc of FT8 decode
* Complete encode proc(should be quite simpler than decode)
All the functions and operations are based on *.wav format file.
